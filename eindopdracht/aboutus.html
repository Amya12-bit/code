          <p>Hi everybody! I‚Äôm Nur and I‚Äôm currently studying criminology at University of Amsterdam. I as a person like to know everything and by that I mean ‚Äòeager to learn‚Äô everything. While I was studying I worked on a lot of cases and got the idea to start this podcast with my friend from another career background. So I hope you can enjoy our podcast!

          <p>Heyyy guys, my name is Aminata, one of the co-host in our Podcast. I'm a huge fan of true crime and love finding out different twisted stories. Also I'm nothing related to true crime so I'm just a big fan!!! When I'm not working you can find me watching the latest documentaries or books about true crime. True crime just fascinates me, the unsolved mysteries and stories. I hope you will like our Podcastüå∂Ô∏è

          <p>Hi fellow crime lovers! My name is Nive and I'm one of the co-host of this podcast. I‚Äôve started this podcast with Nur and Aminata, because I love gorey, spine-shivering and crazy crime stories. I have watched Sam and Colby, Buzzfeed unsolved and Rotten Mango forever and loved the idea of starting a podcast. So here we are, three crime loving lads with a passion for talking and sharing! I hope you like our episodes and support us to make more :)
